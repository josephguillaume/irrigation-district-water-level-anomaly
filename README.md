# Irrigation district water level anomaly detection

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1046720891.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16992253)

Code implementing water level difference and cusum algorithms for water level sensors for irrigation district SCADA data, implemented by the Australian National University and University of Melbourne as part of [One Basin CRC](https://onebasin.com.au/) project [Water infrastructure critical component anomaly detection and health prediction prototype](https://onebasin.com.au/project/water-infrastructure-critical-component-anomaly-detection-and-health-prediction-prototype/), licensed for public use under an MIT license.

Note that code is provided as is, and is not usable without necessary data.
